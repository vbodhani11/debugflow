/**
 * Subscription plan declarations.
 *
 * Add paid tiers here, then `deepspace deploy` to sync them to Stripe Products
 * and Prices. Keep each `slug` stable; subscribers and tier checks refer to it.
 * Users sit on the built-in "free" tier until they subscribe, so declare a free
 * plan only if you want it listed alongside your paid ones.
 *
 * Minimum prices: $3/month, $12/year. Below that Stripe's per-transaction fee
 * ($0.30 + 2.9%) eats most of the charge, so you would receive almost nothing
 * per payout. A plan with priceCents: 0 never hits Stripe.
