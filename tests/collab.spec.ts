/**
 * Multi-user collaboration spec — verifies two users sign in into
 * separate browser contexts and the app distinguishes them.
 *
 * `users(2)` takes any two accounts from your pool, so this spec passes on a
 * fresh app with no setup beyond having two test accounts:
 *   npx deepspace test accounts list
 *   npx deepspace test accounts create --email a@deepspace.test --name "A" --password-stdin
 *
 * Ask for accounts *by name* (`users(['Alice', 'Bob'])`) only when the
 * behaviour under test depends on which identity acts — otherwise naming them
 * couples the spec to one machine's pool.
 *
 * The `users` fixture handles sign-in caching (per-account storageState
 * persisted to `~/.deepspace/playwright-states/`), context creation, and
 * cleanup. No need to manage browser contexts manually.
