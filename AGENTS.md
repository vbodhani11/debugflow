# AGENTS.md

**Load the `deepspace` skill before working in this repo.** It is the source
of truth for the SDK; read project source afterward for repo-specific details.

The scaffold installs the portable skill at
`.agents/skills/deepspace/SKILL.md`. Restart the agent session to load newly
installed skills, or read that file directly. If it is missing, scaffold-time
installation failed (typically a network issue); reinstall:

```sh
npx -y skills@latest add deepdotspace/deepspace-skill -y                 # this project
npx -y skills@latest add deepdotspace/deepspace-skill -g -y              # globally, every project
npx -y skills@latest add deepdotspace/deepspace-skill --agent codex -y   # specific agent
```

If installation is unavailable, read
<https://github.com/deepdotspace/deepspace-skill/blob/main/skills/deepspace/SKILL.md>.

## About this project

This is a **DeepSpace** app — a real-time collaborative app built on the
[`deepspace`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepspace) SDK and deployed to
Cloudflare Workers via `npx deepspace deploy`.

## Version control

The app's **cloud repo** on the DeepSpace platform is the default version
control; no external account is needed. The first DeepSpace push/pull/deploy
command installs its Git remote as `space`. **Don't set up GitHub (or another
git host) unless the developer explicitly asks.** With the default DeepSpace
source, commit before you deploy: the release records that commit and refuses
a dirty worktree. When the app ships from GitHub (latched from the checkout's
remote at the app's first release, permanently), deploy instead ships the
current checkout, including dirty or unpushed bytes, and records no commit
lineage for that release; use ordinary Git to decide what should be committed
and pushed. For parallel DeepSpace-source work: `workspace new -t "<task>"` →
commit → `workspace sync` → `workspace land`. Use `status`, `activity`,
`releases`, and `rollback` to recover context and inspect what is live.

## Project commands

```sh
npx deepspace auth login   # authenticate with app.space
npx deepspace dev start    # local dev server (vite + miniflare)
npx deepspace deploy       # deploy to <app>.app.space
npx deepspace push         # sync code to the app's cloud repo
npx deepspace add --list   # list optional features (messaging, etc.)
npx deepspace add <feature>
```

This starter does not register local agent tool routes by default. To expose
the app's tools to a local assistant, add
`registerAgent(app, { tools: buildTools, inApp: false })` in `worker.ts`
(imports from `src/ai/agent.ts` and `src/ai/tools.ts`) and deploy. After that,
`npx deepspace agent tools <app> --json` discovers the tools and their input
schemas, and `npx deepspace agent invoke <app> <tool> --input-file input.json
--json` runs one — always run `agent tools` first and follow the returned
schema rather than guessing arguments. Both reuse the current CLI login. If
they report `not_authenticated`, run the refusal's action when present. In a
headless shell without an action, run `npx deepspace auth login --help` and use
the operator-supplied credential path it names; never invent credentials or put
a password on the command line.
